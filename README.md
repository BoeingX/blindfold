# Blindfold for LeetCode

> Reduce self imposed anxiety by hiding LeetCode's difficulty, acceptance, and question stats.

## What is this?

This is a simple Chrome extension for hiding LeetCode's difficulty and acceptance info.

## How does this work?

I literally just make like 3 columns transparent on the site.

## Why do this?

It's stressful to look at how difficult a question is or to see how many people got it right. Imagine in an interview, each algorithmic question was prefaced with "Oh any by the way, 96% of applicants got this question correct." I think I'd rather be tossed from an airplane into a flaming pit of scorpions, or have my big toe ran over with a steamroller.
